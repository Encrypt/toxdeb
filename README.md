# ToxDeb

ToxDeb is a bash script which long-term aim is to build Tox clients for Debian platforms.  

For each client and for each distribution, a configuration should be written and put in the configs/ folder.
Various configurations are currently available and will hopefully build: [uTox](https://github.com/grayhatter/utox), [qTox](https://github.com/tux3/qTox) and [Ricin](https://github.com/RicinApp/Ricin).

This script has been adapted to run on [Tox's Jenkins](https://build.tox.chat).
If you wish to run it on your own server, check out the [initial branch](https://github.com/Encrypt/toxdeb/tree/initial).

It is still under development, released under the GPLv3 licence.
